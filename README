==========================================================

1. Compiling etc.

* To build the plugin from source, you'll need the deadbeef and GTK2 headers
  (deadbeef-dev, libgtk2.0-dev)

* To get the sources from git, use the following commands:
    First donwload:   git clone git://deadbeef-fb.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/deadbeef-fb/deadbeef-fb
    Update the tree:  git pull

* Just type "make" to build the plugin as shared library


==========================================================

2. Install

* You don't have to be root to install, as DeaDBeeF also loads plugins
  from your home directory!

* Just type "make install"

* Alternatively, maually copy the file "filebrowser.so" file into the
  directory "$HOME/.local/deadbeef/lib/"


==========================================================

3. Problems?

* If DeaDBeeF stops working after you've installed the plugin, just
  remove the .so file from the directory described above
