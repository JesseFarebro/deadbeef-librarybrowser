==========================================================

1. Compiling etc.

* To build the plugin from source, you'll need the deadbeef and GTK2 headers
  (deadbeef-dev, libgtk2.0-dev).

* To get the sources from git, use the following commands:
    First donwload:   git clone git://deadbeef-fb.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/deadbeef-fb/deadbeef-fb
    Update the tree:  git pull

* Then just follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.
  Basically, you need to run
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
  to compile the sources. After that, the plugin is ready for install.


==========================================================

2. Install

* You can either use one of the provided install scripts, or use
  "make install" as mentioned in the INSTALL file.

* To quickly install the plugin into your home directory, use the
  "userinstall.sh" script. You don't need to be root to do that!
  It will put the plugin file into $HOME/.local/lib/deadbeef/.

* To quickly install the plugin into your system directory, use the
  "quickinstall.sh" script.
  It will put the plugin file into /usr/local/lib/deadbeef/.

* If you want to install the plugin into your system directory (e.g. /usr),
  it's better to compile the program and use "make install", as this
  also takes care of other files like translations!


==========================================================

3. Problems?

* If DeaDBeeF stops working after you've installed the plugin, just
  remove the .so file from the appropriate directory mentioned above.
